# phenology-e-shape
Phenological product generation from Sentinel 2 in ODC, ONDA-DIAS and VLAB.

The code aims to generate a best practice to calculate vegetation phenology measurements following these points:
- Load Sentinel-2 data for an area of interest and time range.
- Calculate a vegetation index: Normalise Different Vegetation Index (NDVI).
- Generate a zonal time series.
- Calculate phenology products:  Greenup, Maturity, Senescence.

The code is written in Python.
In odc and dias folders: the code is written using Jupyter notebooks.
In the VLAB folder, the Python script and the specific folder and files are to be executed through the virtual laboratory: https://vlab.geodab.eu/
